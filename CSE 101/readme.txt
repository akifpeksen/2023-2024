This folder contains the assignments and project of the CSE101 course I took in the 2023-2024 fall semester.
Thanks to these assignments, I better understood the C programming language, which I had just started to learn,
and thanks to the project, I gained comprehensive knowledge about Aurdinho programming by working in coordination with my teammates.
